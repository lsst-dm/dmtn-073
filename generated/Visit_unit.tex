\subsubsection{Visit}
\label{unit:Visit}

A sequence of observations processed together, comprised of one or
more Exposures from the same \unitref{Camera} with the same pointing
and \unitref{PhysicalFilter}. The \unitref{Visit} table contains
metadata that is both meaningful only for science Exposures and the
same for all Exposures in a \unitref{Visit}.

\textbf{Dependencies:} Camera

\textbf{Value Fields:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{visit (int):}
      Unique (with camera) integer identifier for this Visit.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Table:} \hyperref[tbl:Visit]{Visit}

    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | p{0.5\textwidth} |}
      \hline
      \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Attributes} & \textbf{Description} \\
      \hline
      camera & str & PRIMARY KEY &
              The \unitref{Camera} used to observe the Exposures associated
              with this \unitref{Visit}.
          \\
      \hline
      visit & int & PRIMARY KEY &
              Unique (with camera) integer identifier for this
              \unitref{Visit}.
          \\
      \hline
      physical\_filter & str & NOT NULL &
              The bandpass filter used for all exposures in this
              \unitref{Visit}.
          \\
      \hline
      datetime\_begin & datetime &  &
              TAI timestamp of the beginning of the \unitref{Visit}.  This
              should be the same as the datetime\_begin of the first
              \unitref{Exposure} associated with this \unitref{Visit}.
          \\
      \hline
      datetime\_end & datetime &  &
              TAI timestamp of the end of the \unitref{Visit}.  This should
              be the same as the datetime\_end of the last
              \unitref{Exposure} associated with this \unitref{Visit}.
          \\
      \hline
      exposure\_time & float &  &
              The total exposure time of the \unitref{Visit} in seconds.
              This should be equal to the sum of the exposure\_time values
              for all constituent Exposures (i.e. it should not include time
              between Exposures).
          \\
      \hline
      seeing & float &  &
              Average seeing, measured as the FWHM of the Gaussian with the
              same effective area (arcsec).
          \\
      \hline
      region & bytes &  &
              A spatial region on the sky that bounds the area covered by
              the \unitref{Visit}.  This is expected to be more precise than
              the region covered by the SkyPixels associated with the
              \unitref{Visit}, but may still be larger than the
              \unitref{Visit} as long as it fully covers it.  Must also
              fully cover all regions in the \tblref{VisitSensorRegion}
              entries associated with this \unitref{Visit}. Regions are
              lsst.sphgeom.ConvexPolygon objects persisted as portable (but
              not human-readable) bytestrings using the encode and decode
              methods.
