\subsubsection{ExposureRange}
\label{unit:ExposureRange}

An inclusive range of Exposures that may be open in either direction,
typically used to identify master calibration products. There is no
SQL table associated with ExposureRanges; there is no additional
information associated with an \unitref{ExposureRange} besides the
camera, valid\_first, and valid\_last fields already present in
\tblref{Dataset}.

\textbf{Dependencies:} Camera

\textbf{Value Fields:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{valid\_first (int):}
      first exposure identifier included in the range (inclusive).  may
      be zero to indicate an open interval.
  \item \textbf{valid\_last (int):}
      last exposure identifier included in the range (inclusive).  may
      be max(int) to indicate an open interval.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Table:} none
